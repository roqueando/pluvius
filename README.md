> Pluvius is a simple rain predict app for machine learning engineering study purpose


### updates and improvements

the project still in development and the next updates will be coded in the following tasks:
- [x] model training and ONNX saving
- [ ] create a worker pipeline with haskell for preprocessing
- [ ] create an evaluation API for prediction

## üíª pre-requisites

before start, verify if you have the following things:

- you have installed the most recent version of [Haskell](https://haskell.com) and `cabal` (you can install it with [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)) in your machine
- you have installed the most recent version of `python`, `pip` in your machine
- you have installed [Docker](https://docker.com) and docker compose

## üöÄ installing pluvius

For install `pluvius` first you need:

- clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/roqueando/pluvius.git
```

- build featurizer
```sh
make build/featurizer
```
- create a virtualenv for python stuff
```sh
make setup/python
```

- install python dependencies
```sh
make setup/dependencies
```

## ‚òïusing pluvius

To use pluvius you will need the correct dataset, then use the download script to get the INMETBR dataset (for now I'm just using Brazilian data)
```sh
python collect-dataset.py
```

### Running preprocessing
Here we will need to pre process all dataset to fit into model, so we will run the preprocess dockerized app

```sh
docker run -d --name preprocess pluvius/preprocess
```
This will run the Haskell worker to find the csv 

- change directory to `science`, install dependencies and train the model
```sh
cd science
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
```
it can be a little slower depending on your PC settings

- more incoming of how to up the rust environment

## ‚òïusing pluvius 

- still working... :D
